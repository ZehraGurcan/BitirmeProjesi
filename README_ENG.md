# 🌸Bloom Survival

A survival game where you live the fragile life of a flower.

## 🎮About the Game

Bloom Survival is a survival game developed as part of the Üretken Akademi Graduation Project.
You play as a flower trying to survive the challenges of nature. To stay alive, you must carefully manage your Sunlight ☀️, Water 💧, and Soil 🌱 levels.

If any of these bars drop to zero by the end of the day, your health decreases.

If your health reaches zero or if someone finds you and throws you away, the game ends.

You have an inventory system where you can store sunlight, water, and soil to use when needed.

The goal is simple yet challenging: survive as long as possible.

## ✨ Features

🌞 Resource Management → Keep your sunlight, water, and soil balanced.

💖 Health System → Your flower’s life depends on maintaining resources.

🎒 Inventory System → Store and use collected sunlight, water, and soil.

🚪 Game Over Mechanics → Death occurs when resources deplete or if you are discarded.

🎨 Unique Concept → Experience survival from the perspective of a flower.
